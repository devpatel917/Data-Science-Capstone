The data that will used is the number of venues (schools, work areas, large groups of people) and the distance from its centroid (the assumed restaurant location). To do this, only Foursquare location data will be used to find the different venues and see their apparent distances from the restaurant location.

            "source": "Discussion: From these results, the Woburn neighborhood is the best to start a restaurant. Even though it might not be in the center of a lot of different people or with a large variet of people, it is very close to different places like schools and other jobs where large clusters of people can be found. In this way, they would likely be attracted to going to a restaurant near where they work or go to school. It's a true application of where quality over the quantity matters. Another observation I found was that there were many neighborhoods that might already have restaurants, which is not the best place to have another restaurant. The place found has less restaurants, signifying less competition and more awe and attaction towards the business. "

It has tremendous potential to succeed in this area, but be cautious of the limiations that it might provide. To conclude, this project truly gave me insight in how to use data science in a real life application. I feel rewarded the time and effort that I spent on this project to find the right place to open a restaurant and was interesting to see the different factors and the numerical values that hold those factors. Manipulating those and analyzing those patterns and factors shed light on the wide array of applications data science can truly provide. "
