The restaurant will be located near schools, work areas, and areas of large groups of people, so that they would want to come to the restaurant since it's close for them. The data that will used is the number of venues (schools, work areas, large groups of people) and the distance from its centroid (the assumed restaurant location). To do this, only Foursquare location data will be used to find the different venues and see their apparent distances from the restaurant location. Minimizing the distance and maximizing the number of venues will the goal. \n"
